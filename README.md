## Bertelsmann Scholarship

### Project: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
(AWS SageMaker)

Built and deployed a neural network that predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review. In addition, creating a simple web app that uses the deployed model

### Project: Face Generation
(GAN, Python)

Defined two adversarial networks, a generator and a discriminator, and trained them until they were able to generate realistic faces

### Project: TV Script Generation
(RNN, Python)

Generated a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network

### Project: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
Built and trained a Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bike share users on a given day
